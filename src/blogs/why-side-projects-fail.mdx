### Why Side Projects Fail Before the First Commit

Most side projects don’t fail because of bad code, missing frameworks, or the wrong tech stack.
They fail *before* the first line of code is even written.

The real reason?  
The problem was never clearly defined.

Developers often jump straight into implementation:
setting up a repo, configuring linting, choosing a framework, and deploying a skeleton app.
It feels productive—but it’s usually just motion without direction.

Before long, motivation drops. The project stalls. And eventually, it’s abandoned.

#### Clarity Beats Motivation

Motivation is unreliable. Clarity isn’t.

When you clearly define what you’re building, decisions become easier:
- What features matter
- What can wait
- What “done” actually means

Without that clarity, every decision feels heavy—and every change feels like rework.

#### Tasks vs Outcomes

“Build authentication” is a task.  
“Users can securely sign up, log in, and reset passwords” is an outcome.

Tasks create movement.
Outcomes create progress.

Most abandoned projects are full of tasks—but empty of outcomes.

#### A Simple Fix That Actually Works

Before starting your next side project, answer these questions:

- Who is this for?
- What problem does it solve?
- What must exist for version 1 to be complete?

Write the answers down. Break them into concrete deliverables.
Only then should you open your editor.

#### What This Looks Like in Practice

I’ve used this approach to:
- Kill weak ideas early (saving weeks of effort)
- Ship smaller but complete MVPs
- Stay motivated because progress was measurable

It’s not about working harder.
It’s about working with intent.

The next time you feel stuck on a side project, don’t add more tools.
Add more clarity.
